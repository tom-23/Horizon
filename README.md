# Horizon
A digital audio workstation written in c++ and using the Labsound library for audio playback.
## Getting started
First clone the git repository to a directory with the following git command:
```
git clone http://tom-butcher.ml:2233/git/tom/Horizon.git
```
Then, you need to init the submodule(s):
```
git submodule init
```
And then update the submodules with the recursive and init flags:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Finally, I would open the project up in QT Creator to start developing or follow the instructions online on how to build a QT project form the command line. It isn't difficult to do so.
